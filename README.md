# Xs-and-Os
Xs and Os is a simple tic-tac-toe game for Android having different game modes.
It is written in KOTLIN, the modern language for developing Android apps
and is having a simple UI made by using different android components like:
TextViews, Buttons, TableLayout, TableRows, RelativeLayout etc.
For now, the game has only Local 2-players mode. In the future, two more modes will be added that are:
Play With Device(having 2 Difficulty levels) and Online Multiplayer mode. 
This app is just created to get some familiarity with the Kotlin language, otherwise this game is not something new.
